# Laravel Assistant

This is an example Dagger LLM Module, written in PHP, that can be used to look at an existing local Laravel project, check git for changes, and assist with determining the correct tests to run based on the code changes.

It will also write the test code into the workspace and run tests until they pass and provide a summary of the changes and the tests that were run.
